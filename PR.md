### List on iPhone/mobile games pages ###
We should list Dark Nova on every iPhone apps/games page and mobile apps/games site we can find.

### PR Announcement for Releases ###
For releases with new features we should issue basic press releases to iPhone and mobile gaming news sites.

### Reviews ###
Once the app is stable, we should encourage reviews of it, including submitting it for reviews at iPhone and mobile gaming sites and blogs. Even not-great reviews will get us some more users.

### Wikipedia Page ###
We shold have a Wikipedia page for DN. This needs to be totally neutral, just stating facts about the game. We should add it to the iPhone games category (See Space Trader Wikipedia page 'links' section for how to do it.)

### Interviews ###
We should conduct and publish interviews with DN staff, testers, and especially Pieter. These can just be email interviews, or maybe even podcasts.

### Cross-promotion with other games? ###
Are there similar iPhone games we could mention in return for them mentioning us? Are there space trader games on other system where we could promote their PC and Xbox games in return for them promoting Dark Nova?

### Charity promotions ###
If DN is going to be charged for, how about giving a small percent of profits to the charity Child's Play? (http://www.childsplaycharity.org/) That would be great publicity. And who's going to give a charity game a bad review? (/cynic\_mode)

If it's not going to be charged for, how about a charity edition of the game (with no real difference from the normal game, it just says 'charity edition' somewhere) where it costs a dollar and the money goes to charity. Once again great publicity.
