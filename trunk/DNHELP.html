<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bookmark:Introduction'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>You grew up as a member
of a small colony on a planet in a solar system that is part of the Great
Galactic Federation (GGF). You worked on your family's farm, dreaming about a
life as an intergalactic trader. You imagined yourself buying goods on one
system, selling them on another making huge profits, battling pirates, finding
opportunities and perhaps, one day, buy your own moon to which you could retire
to live a wealthy and peaceful life for the rest of your days. <br>
After your parents died, as their only child you inherited the farm. Since it
would be too difficult to run it all on your own, you saw your chance clear and
sold it to a neighbor. With the earnings, you bought a second-hand space ship
of the Minox type, equipped it with one pulse laser, and went to the local GGF
spaceport to buy trade goods with your last 1000 credits. This is where your
life as a space trader begins. </span></span><span style='mso-bookmark:Introduction'></span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;color:white'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h2><a name=Job><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Your Job as a Space
Trader</span><span style='color:white'><o:p></o:p></span></a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bookmark:Job'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Arial;color:white'>Your ultimate goal as a space trader is to amass
enough money so you can buy your own moon, then claim that moon to retire to
it. You need a lot of money for that, and will encounter many dangers, so along
the way you might want to buy a better ship and better equipment. <br>
At first, the main point is to stay alive, and earn some money by trading. The
GGF has a spaceport in every solar system, where goods locally produced are
sold, and goods the locals need are bought. A good trader will judge, based on
the systems tech level, government type, resources and current situation, which
goods are cheap and which are expensive in a system, and will adapt his trading
strategy accordingly. <br>
Later on, when you are better equipped, you might try to become a bounty hunter
alongside your trading job. If you feel so inclined, you might also become a
pirate and rob other traders of their goods. Being a pirate can be very
profitable, but remember that the police will try to hunt you down, and that,
as a pirate, you cannot sell goods out in the open (even those that you bought
legally). You need an intermediary to sell your goods, and this sleazy person
will take 10% of everything your cargo sells for. This makes the return to an
honest life all the more difficult. </span></span><span style='mso-bookmark:
Job'></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;color:white'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h2><a name=Trading><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Trading</span><span
style='color:white'><o:p></o:p></span></a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bookmark:Trading'><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>You usually start trading by selling the
goods you currently have in your cargo holds, so you earn enough money to buy
new goods. You can, of course, leave them stored in your holds if you expect it
is worth your while to travel to another system to sell them. <br>
As long as you have empty cargo bays and cash, and as long as the spaceport has
affordable goods available, you can buy goods. Before you choose what you are
going to buy, however, it is best to consider which system you are going to
sell them to. The Short Range Chart in your ship will show which systems are
within range. Before you examine the Short Range Chart, you best get a full
tank of fuel at the Ship Yard. This will make it easier for you to find out
which systems you can travel to. The price for fuel depends on the type of
ship. While you are at the Yard, you can make hull repairs if you feel that's
necessary. <br>
The Short Range Chart is connected to an encyclopedia, which can tell you a few
things about a system. Most important to decide which system you select, as
your next target is the Average Price List of that system. This shows you which
goods might be expected to earn you a profit. Note that there is no guarantee
that you will actually get the price shown in the list. It doesn't take into
account special resources (unless you know about them) and special situations
of the target system. And prices always fluctuate a bit. <br>
Another thing, which might be of importance to you, is how many pirates you
might expect en route to your selected system. Especially early in your career,
you might wish to avoid systems which are heavily infested with pirates. The
same holds for the police when you are trafficking illegal goods. <br>
When you know which system you want to travel to, you can buy the appropriate
cargo, and warp away. <br>
When you feel you'd like to lend a bit of money so you can start off your
trading career a bit faster, you can apply for a loan at the local bank.
Depending on your police record and your current worth, the bank will probably
be willing to help you out. Note, however, that 10% interest must be paid
daily, which will be automatically deducted from your cash balance when you go
into warp. </span></span><span style='mso-bookmark:Trading'></span><span

<h2><a name=Spaceships><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Spaceships</span><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bookmark:Spaceships'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Every type of ship has
certain characteristics, making some ships better for trading and others better
for pirating or bounty hunting. Your first ship, of the Minox type, is mainly
used for trading since it is rather weak and has few defensive capabilities.
You might be able to win a few battles with it, though, especially if you are a
good fighter. Later on, you can buy a ship better suited to your purpose. <br>
Ships differ in their hull strengths, number of cargo bays, number of weapon
slots, number of shield slots, number of gadget slots, number of crew quarters
and maximum travelling range. At the Ship Yard, they will be able to inform you
about the capabilities of each ship. <br>
When you decide to buy a new ship, you trade in your old one, including its
equipment. The worth of your ship, including its cargo and equipment, is
subtracted from the price of the new ship. You should be warned that if you
have cargo on board which the people in the current system don't want, you
would lose that cargo without any compensation. You therefore better sell a
ship with empty cargo bays. If you have an escape pod installed on your old
ship that will be transferred to your new ship. Any insurance you have will
also be transferred, including no-claim. <br>
Equipment you can buy for your ship is divided in three groups. The first group
consists of weapons, and you can select one of three types of lasers for each
weapon slot. The more expensive a laser, the more power it has. The second
group consists of shields, and you can choose one of two shields for each
shield slot. The more expensive the shield is, the better the protection it
gives. The last group consists of gadgets, which may enhance certain functions
of a ship. <br>
The most important part of a spaceship is its hull. If the hull strength is
reduced to zero percent during a fight, the ship will explode, killing everyone
on it and destroying everything it was carrying. You might fly your ship with
low hull strength, but it is best not to do that. Repairs can be made at the
Ship Yard and are fairly cheap, especially for the smaller ship types. The only
way to survive the destruction of your ship is to have an escape pod installed,
which will eject you automatically when your ship can't be saved anymore. </span></span><span

     actually consumes the fuel. You materialize at a safe distance from the
     target system's spaceport, usually about 20 clicks.</span></span><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bookmark:Travelling'><span

lucky to have a wormhole nearby. A wormhole is a rift in the space-time
continuum, which leads directly from one place in the galaxy to another. You
can use the wormhole to travel to another system in an instant, even if that
other system is at the other end of the galaxy. You can only enter a wormhole
from the spaceport of the system that owns it. That system will tax you for the
use of the wormhole. The tax depends on your ship type: poor traders with a
small ship pay considerably less than rich traders with a huge ship. On the
plus side: you won't spend any fuel travelling through a wormhole, which
compensates partly for the tax. </span></span><span style='mso-bookmark:Travelling'></span><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bookmark:Skills'><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>There are four basic skills important to
a trader. You will probably excel in one or two skills, and lack in the others.
However, you can compensate for that by hiring mercenaries. Mercenaries have
skills just like you, and if a mercenary is, for instance, a better pilot than
you are, he or she will take over your piloting duties when needed. Mercenaries
can sometimes be hired at a spaceport. Just examine the Personnel Roster to see
if anyone is available. If you hire a mercenary, you have to pay him or her a
certain amount of credits daily. You have to cough these up right before you
warp, otherwise the mercenary simply won't travel with you, but instead return
to his or her home system. </span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bookmark:Pilot'><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The pilot skill determines how well you
pilot your ship. A high piloting skill will enable you to flee from attacks
easily, dodge attacks, and to stay on the tail of fleeing ships if you want to
keep attacking them. This makes the piloting skill important to both traders
and pirates. A navigating system will enhance your piloting capabilities. </span></span><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bookmark:Fighter'><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The fighter skill determines how well you
handle your weapons, in particular, how easy it is for you hit another ship. A
trader who isn't interested in a pirating or bounty hunting career hasn't that
much use of this skill, but for a pirate it is an absolute must. A targeting
system will enhance your fighting capabilities. </span></span><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bookmark:Traderskill'><span

determines what prices you must pay for trade goods, ships and equipment. A
good trader can reduce prices up to 10%. This makes a high trader skill
invaluable for traders, while pirates have less use for it. In the early stages
of your life as a trader you might have a hard time getting any money if you
work with low trading capabilities. </span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

you keep your ship in shape. A good engineer may keep your hull and shields
intact during a fight, will repair them quicker while travelling, and may even
enhance your weaponry a bit so it does more damage. This makes the engineer
skill important for both traders and pirates. An auto-repair system will
enhance the engineering capabilities. </span></span><span style='mso-bookmark:

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bookmark:Trader'><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>When you encounter a trader, the trader
will usually ignore you. Occasionally a trader will hail you to ask whether you
want to trade some goods. The deal offered might be good, but the trader might
try to rip you off. Caveat emptor. If you have a bad reputation, the trader
might flee on sight. A trader will never initiate an attack, but may respond
aggressively when you do. While fighting, you have the option to continue
attacking or to flee. If a trader finds the fight goes bad for him and he can't
manage to flee from you, he will often surrender to you. If he surrenders, you
may continue attacking, but you best accept his offer, because after that you
can plunder his cargo holds. If you don't have enough room to store all the
nice goods you rob, you can dump some of your own cargo is space. Beware,
however, that the police frowns upon space littering and such actions will go
on your record if they are noticed. </span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<h3><a name=Pirate><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>An Encounter
with a Pirate<o:p></o:p></span></a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bookmark:Pirate'><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>A pirate will usually attack as soon as
he sees you, unless your reputation is such that he is afraid of you, in which
case he might flee. While fighting a pirate, you can attack him or try to flee.
You can even surrender to him, but in that case he will plunder your cargo
holds. If you think you are smart and have nothing in your holds, he will
extort cash from you under the threat of blowing your ship up. Surrender is
therefore a bad option, though it is better than fighting to the death. In rare
cases a pirate might decide to surrender to you. Plundering his ship usually
isn't as profitable as plundering a trader, because a pirate tends to travel
with many empty holds to store the goods he intends to get by robbing traders. </span></span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h3><a name=Police><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>An Encounter
with the Police<o:p></o:p></span></a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bookmark:Police'><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>As long as you are an honest trader, the
police will usually ignore you. They may ask you to submit to an inspection of
your cargo bays. As long as you are not carrying illegal goods (firearms or
narcotics), you have nothing to worry about: they will search your holds,
apologize, and up the status on your police record, indicating that you are
someone who doesn't need to be searched that often. However, if you are carrying
illegal goods, you best not let them search you, because then they will impound
the illegal goods and fine you. Instead of agreeing to an inspection, you can
try to bribe them. Depending on the type of government of the system, this is
either impossible (if they are incorruptible), or costs an amount of money
depending on how easy police officers under such a government can be bribed. It
is always a good idea to explore the option of bribery: you can decide not to
bribe them when you see how much money they want, but you might get away cheap.
The other options you have are to flee, or to attack them, in which case they
will certainly attack you. Both fleeing and attacking will seriously damage
your standing with the police. When your police record indicates that you are a
criminal, police ships won't ask for an inspection anymore, but will attack you
on sight. If your reputation indicates that you are too dangerous an opponent
for them, they also might flee immediately. When they consider you a really
dangerous criminal, they will send more and better ships after you. You can
surrender to the police, as long as you are not considered a psychopath they
rather take in dead. If you do, you will be taken to a court of law and tried.
You will have to spend some time in prison and pay a fine. If you don't have
the credits to settle your fine, the police will sell your ship and will pay
the fine out of the profits. If they need to do that, they will usually supply
you with a second-hand Nanomite when you leave prison. To avoid you having to
pay huge interests on a loan, if you have the credits, the police will usually
also settle those debts from your cash. Also remember that you can't pay your
mercenaries and insurance from your cell, so your hired hands will leave you
and your insurance will be stopped. </span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

fight, and no one manages to escape and no-one surrenders, the fight will end
in the destruction of one or both ships. If you get destroyed, and you have no
escape pod, you will perish with your ship. If you survive and your opponent
gets killed, if you are lucky one of the cargo canisters from his ship will
drift in your direction and you can pick it up. </span></span><span

protect your hull from damage. When you are attacked, first your shields are

extra cargo bays. These are fairly cheap and allow you to carry more cargo, so
you probably earn them back quickly. If there is more than one gadget slot on
your ship, you can even install more than one of this gadget, increasing your
cargo bays even more. A navigating system helps you piloting your ship. An
auto-repair system helps your engineering functions. A targeting system helps
you handle your weaponry. A cloaking device is perhaps the most interesting
gadget a trader can buy. It is very expensive, but it allows you to travel
through space undetected, as long as you don't attack. However, a good engineer
might detect a cloaked ship by its warp signature. The only way to avoid being
detected is to employ your own engineering skills to fluctuate your warp
signature. If a ship you pass has a better engineer than your own ship, you
can't expect to stay undetected, though. But even if you are detected, your
cloaking device is useful, since it makes you more difficult to hit and you can

You have to pay a daily rate, which depends on the worth of your ship, for the
insurance. This rate will drop 1% for every day you don't claim, up to a
reduction of 90%. Since the no-claim gets transferred to a new ship when you
buy one, it may be useful to rack up your no-claim days with a cheap ship,
before you buy an expensive one. Note that after an ejection, you have to buy a
new escape pod and thus new insurance. Your no-claim will be reset to 0%. </span></span><span

use it, you can convert the pod, which is basically a Nanomite without fuel
tanks and cargo bays, into a Nanomite in a few days time for a few credits.
This is always worth your while, since the Nanomite can be sold for a higher
price than you needed to invest to build it, and it will allow you to travel

minimally needed to make use of certain goods, you won't be able to sell those

influences the price you have to pay for goods and the price you get for

natural goods with you as trade, and you will be astounded at the profits you
can make. </span></span><span style='color:white'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bookmark:Polictical'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Each of the solar
systems has a government. The type of government influences mainly the number
of police ships, pirates and traders you will encounter en route to that
system, how easy it is to bribe government officials, and whether or not
certain goods are forbidden in the system. Government types that attract pirates
usually scare traders away, which mean that, since they can't import much,
their markets are willing to pay good money for almost everything you bring
them. </span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

government at all. It's every man for himself. No one will volunteer to protect
the others, resulting in a total lack of a police force and crime everywhere.
Traders fear to visit an anarchy. Regardless the technological development,
anarchies may arise when the time is ripe for a revolt. If the tech level has
at that point reached a post-industrial state, the system will usually fall
back to an earlier state because of the ensuing chaos. Due to the lack of
co-operation in an anarchy, even the first needs of life are scarce, and food
might bring a reasonably good price. </span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

based on the principle of fair trade, often not excluding the trade in illegal
goods. Government's interference in society's affairs occurs seldom, and a
police force is only supported to protect the individual rights of the
citizens. Traders are welcomed enthusiastically. There is no system in which
people are as free and wealthy as in a capitalist state (mostly because those
that are unwilling or unable to work have little chance to survive), and therefore
criminals, who often recruit their confederates amongst the poor and
discontented, find it difficult to root in such a system. Industrial
developments are needed for a capitalist state to develop. Ore, needed for
construction, is often in high demand. </span></span><span style='font-size:

individual are subjugated to the rights of society as a whole. There is no
individual freedom in a communist state, and a strong police force sees to it
that this is the way things stay. However, since the police force mostly exists
to suppress the citizens, and people crave for illegal goods, crime is also
abundant, and bribes are readily accepted. The few incorruptible policemen may
deal harshly with traders in illegal goods, though. Industrial developments are
difficult to achieve under this form of government. </span></span><span

of a number of previously independent states, which have decided to unite under
one government. The states may still decide many things on their own, but the
central government certainly makes them stronger. The police force is fairly
strong and knows how to deal with traders in illegal goods. Crime levels are
moderate. Traders may find lucrative business here, and technological
developments can range all across the scale, though for really hi-tech
developments the states need to integrate a little bit more. People like to be
entertained and you may get a fine price for games. </span></span><span

expanded so far that it literally owns the whole system. The police force is
paid by the corporation and is strong and motivated, minimizing crime. Traders
are very welcome, and they, in their turn, love corporations, which support
successful business enterprises. Corporations don't mind trading illegal stuff:
as long as a profit is made, everybody is happy. The police whose reports are
also reviewed by the Space Corps won't let you get away easily trafficking them
though. A corporation needs at least an industrial tech level to be able to
grow into a corporate state. To stimulate production, robots are highly
demanded. </span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bookmark:Cybernetic'><span

arise from a hi-tech society in which people integrate with their computers to
such a level that they become inseparable. Citizens have no need for illegal
goods and won't trade them, though they don't really mind if someone carries
them. Both police force and pirates are strong. It's indeed true that they tend
to destroy each other a lot, but because most of them have backed up their
lives on a hard disk somewhere, they simply don't care. Traders like to buy
hi-tech goods from a cybernetic state, where they are often cheap. To build all
the machines, the state needs ore and you might fetch a good price for that. </span></span><span

counts. People are free to think and act as they like, and the government
represents the majority of the people. Since in a democracy the rights of the
individual, even the criminal, are respected, the police sometimes have troubles
dealing with criminals. That's why the police force isn't very strong in a
democracy, but the chances for crime to bloom aren't that great also.
Democracies often lead to a fairly rich population, which makes the system
attractive for traders, even those in illegal goods. Democracies may arise
wherever freedom is respected. Since people are free to entertain themselves,
games are in demand. </span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:

self-proclaimed usurper reigns according to his whims. He often supports a strong
police force, but uses that mostly to protect his own possessions, and
criminals will find many ways to practice their arts. Since the usurper is very
wealthy, traders who aren't too easily scared often find a visit to a
dictatorship worthwhile. Depending on the enlightenment of the dictator, a
dictatorship might advance very far technologically speaking. </span></span><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bookmark:Fascist'><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>A fascist state is ruled by a strong
military force, and is based on fear and hatred for everyone and everything
from outside. Police is everywhere, and illegal activities are dealt with
swiftly and efficiently. However, certain government institutions have a lot of
power and tend to abuse that power by raiding random ships, without fear of
retribution. Drug abuse is considered the worst crime imaginable, punishable by
death. People fear to trade narcotics for that reason so it won't do a trader
any good to ship them in. Traders usually avoid fascist regimes, because they
are treated with contempt and disgust. Fascist states can occur at any level of
technological development where mass media are supported. To churn out all the
weaponry needed for the suppression of the people, fascist states especially
like to buy machines. </span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:

of small countries, each ruled by an independent king or baron, often at war
with several of their neighbors. Except for a hired guard here and there, there
is no police force to speak of and pirates have free reign. Illegal goods are
readily accepted, but traders fear to visit these systems. Due to the lack of
co-operation between the countries, technological developments are almost
impossible in a feudal state. They usually will pay a good price for firearms,
though. </span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;

The police force is strong and incorruptible, making crime virtually absent in
such a system. For traders there is a lot to gain here, except those that deal
in narcotics since drug dealing deserves capital punishment, which has removed
all potential buyers from the system. Military states are encountered with any
tech level, which at least supports the use of firearms. They like to use
robots for combat, so you can sell them here for a fine price. </span></span><span

who leaves his subjects free to seek their own ways. The king protects his
subjects with a reasonably strong police force, and crime levels are moderate.
Traders fairly often visit monarchies. After a state has reached a high enough
technological level, however, people tend to get annoyed with the harmless
whims of their ruler and replace him with another form of government. The king
usually likes to take good care of his people, and medicine is often in high
demand. </span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;

12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Under a pacifist government, love and
respect for nature dictates the way of the people. The citizens are peaceful
and abhor crime, so for criminals, especially those that deal in firearms,
there isn't much to gain here. Due to the lack of crime, the police force can
also be minimal. Traders like to visit pacifist states, though they will mostly
bring in natural resources, since people won't produce or find use for
technological products. </span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bookmark:Socialist'><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>A socialist state is based on the
principle that people should take care of each other. While this may work as
long as just a few people take advantage of the welfare system, it crashes when
the productive part of society realizes that they are forced to support not
only the needy, but also the lazy. Production tends to slow down at that point,
which ultimately results in the fact that a socialist state will never enter a
post-industrial era. The police force is weak and corrupt, and crime can
blossom. Usually illegal goods are rejected by official policies, but
unofficially are readily accepted. </span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>When a society has reached a state of
Satori (&quot;enlightenment&quot;), the citizens can be compared to Zen monks.
They are poor but content, even happy, and don't have much interest in worldly
goods. They will usually lead an agricultural life. There is little police
around, but a police force is not needed anyway, because crime is virtually
non-existent. Traders find there's little to gain in such a system, especially
if they try to sell illegal goods, and will usually just pass it by. </span></span><span

believe that for every problem there is a technological solution. There is no
fear to experiment with new technologies, because, if there is a problem,
another technology may be developed to deal with it. Anything made by human
hands, even firearms and narcotics, interest the citizens of a technocracy,
even if they themselves are peaceful and shun the use of drugs. A strong police
force will protect the citizens, and crime has little chance. Traders like the technologies
they may find in such a system. Any system, which is at least industrial in
nature, may become a technocracy. Due to the lack of interest in the natural
environment, water is often polluted in a technocracy and there is a great need
for imported fresh water. </span></span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

worshipping of one or more gods. People live in moderation and let commandments
rule their lives. Illegal goods are strictly forbidden and a strong police
force makes sure every citizen adheres to that. Crime is minimal, trading is
moderate. Science is almost at a standstill in a theocracy, so one won't
encounter it in industrial states. Even though narcotics are forbidden and
difficult to sneak by the police, they are in demand for ritualistic purposes
and you can sell them for a good price. </span></span><span style='color:white'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

     Besides, when one of the pirate ships in a system has robbed you, he will

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>At which system can I
buy a moon or sell tribbles?<br>
</span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Sorry,
I can't tell you. This is decided randomly at the start of the game. However,
four systems sell a moon (if your net worth is at least 400,000 credits) and
three systems buy tribbles (if you have them on board). So if you just coast
from system to system you are bound to encounter one of them eventually. Also,
since version 1.2.0 newspapers may give information on where to find a moon
seller or tribble buyer.</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;color:white'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><a name=Berger></a><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I can't find professor
Berger. Where is he? <br>
</span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>He
should be on some Hi-Tech system, but it's determined randomly which system. If
you can't find him, just surrender to the aliens, and they will take the
artifact from you without harming you any further. I have checked whether there
is an error in this quest, but until now I have always found Berger's hiding
place.</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;color:white'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><a name=Tribbles></a><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>How do I get rid of
those annoying tribbles?<br>
</span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The
tribbles are kind of a joke, added as a tribute to the original C64 version of
Elite. The best way to get rid of them is to find a place to sell them. Three
solar systems in the galaxy enable you to do that, and they can bring great
profits. You can also get rid of them by selling or destroying your ship, but
that'll cost you. It's up to you to think of a way to reduce those costs
considerably. There is yet another method of removing tribbles, which ties in
with one of the new quests. You discover this automatically if it applies to
you.</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;color:white'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><a name=BuyWeapons></a><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>How do I buy weapons for
my ship? How do I get to the bank?<br>
</span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Use the
Command button on the lower icon menu.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>This menu allows access to all game functions, including buying and
selling of equipment, the galactic chart and the bank.</span><span

<p><a name=Percentage></a><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I don't understand what
the scoring percentage means!<br>
</span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>It's an
indication of how well you played the game. It is tuned so that when you win
the game by claiming a moon in average time with an average amount of money on
Normal difficulty level, you score 100%. If you play on Beginner or Easy level,
you will probably never reach 100%. If you play on Hard or Impossible and win
the game, you will probably score a lot higher than 100%. I have had reports of
people scoring close to 300% on Impossible level. Incidentally, the help text
that explains the scoring mechanism contains some errors in version 1.1.2 and
lower. It is corrected for version 1.2.0.</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p><a name=Interest></a><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I have a huge debt but I
don't pay interest!<br>
</span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I am
sorry to disappoint you, but you actually <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>do</i>
pay interest. It's just that the interest is not, like in similar games, added
to your debt, but automatically deducted from you cash balance as soon as you
warp. Only if you don't have enough cash, your debt is increased. You can see
this on the Target System screen, where you can get a specification of the warp
costs. I did this in order to not let players run around gathering debts and
then finishing the game without ever paying them off again.</span><span

<p><a name=TooHard></a><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>This game is too hard!<br>
</span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>That's
why there is a difficulty level, which you can set from the New Commander
screen. &quot;Beginner&quot; level is definitely easy, indeed, it's too easy,
and it's only meant to get a feeling for the game without dying every few days.
&quot;Easy&quot; level is a bit challenging for new players, but after a game
on this level you'll probably want to switch to &quot;Normal&quot;. &quot;Normal&quot;
is the way the game was originally implemented, before the difficulty levels
were added. This level is definitely playable: I for one have no problems
playing this level to the end. You have to find the right tactics, though.
&quot;Hard&quot; level is indeed hard. I find it very challenging.
&quot;Impossible&quot; level is a lot harder than &quot;Hard&quot;, and to be honest;
I have never tried playing it. I have had many reports of people winning this
level, though.</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;color:white'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><a name=NoMoney></a><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I can't seem to make any
money!<br>
</span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The
best way to make money is to use the special events, which sometimes occur in
solar systems. For instance, when there is a drought people pay a lot for
water, when they lack workers they pay huge prices for machinery and robots,
and when it's very cold, they crave furs. The <a
href="http://ticc.uvt.nl/%7Epspronck/spacetrader/SpaceTrader.html"><span
style='color:white'>documentation</span></a> gives the specifics on all the
trade goods in this respect.</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;color:white'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><a name=PsychoRating></a><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I'm a
crook/criminal/villain/psycho. How do I get rid of that rating?<br>
</span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Being a
villain or psycho can be tough. The police will send strong ships after you.
But you deserved it: you attacked police ships or innocent traders. And not
just one, a whole lot of them. Your police record will slowly revert back to
clean over time. However, if you are a psycho this can take something like
three game months (and a lot longer on Hard or Impossible level). So what can
you do? Apart from stopping attacking police ships and traders (every attack
will hurt your record), your best bet is to go hunt pirates. Every pirate you
kill will help your record. If you are lucky, you might encounter a hacker who
is willing to reset your record to clean for a price. And if all else fails,
surrender to the police and you will be punished, after which you can resume
your life as an honest trader. Psychos don't have that last option, though.</span><span
