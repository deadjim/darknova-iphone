# Introduction #

Just a basic long-term roadmap with target features for new versions.


# Details #

Here's a rough roadmap of what I'm thinking for the game:

  * 1.0xx - Fix bugs and all issues effecting game play, tune play mechanics, revise sound, add some additional feedback
  * 1.1 - Enhance battle encounter graphics to add weapon animation, add more quests and more in-depth quests, revise sound.
  * 1.2-1.4 - Expand universe, major item & ship expansion. Extensive re-write to modularize quests and allow for quest editor. Add stations / bars.
  * 1.5 - Enable limited multi player. Players can interact in a limited fashion at space stations and bars. Possibilities for player-player messaging, wall-writing, gambling (mini-games) etc. Test client/server operation.
  * 2.0 - Dark Nova Online. Online persistent world. Players can battle, trade, form guilds, pool resources, etc.
