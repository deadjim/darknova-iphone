Ideas for changes to the game to help promote the DN community.

(General community ideas are on another Wiki page.)

=== On-line Announcements ===
At milestone points in the game (like upgrading a ship, retiring, etc) the user is offered the ability to post that achievement on on-line, straight from the app.

Initial sites to do this on are:
   * Facebook, using FB Connect
   * Twitter, using the Twitter API

=== Recommend to a friend ===
From within the game it should be possible to recommend the game to a friend. Possible ways to do this are:
   * launch pre-filled email for the user to send to friends
   * using FB connect
   * tweet on Twitter

=== On-line High Score Tables ===
While an overall 'who scored the highest ever' is fun, the key here is to allow comparison with friends. One way to do this is via FB connect, showing your high scores alongside all your FB friends' high scores.
