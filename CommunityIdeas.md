### Links to on-line presence ###
Within the game have simple links that launch Safari to the following touch points on the web:
- twitter
- FB
- darknova.net

This is the simplest thing we can do that encourages users to follow us on FB and Twitter.

### On-line Announcements ###
At milestone points in the game (like upgrading a ship, retiring, etc) the user is offered the ability to post that achievement on on-line, straight from the app.

Initial sites to do this on are:
  * Facebook, using FB Connect
  * Twitter, using the Twitter API

FB even has an Objective-C library for this: http://wiki.developers.facebook.com/index.php/Facebook_Connect_for_iPhone

### Recommend to a friend ###
From within the game it should be possible to recommend the game to a friend. Possible ways to do this are:
  * launch pre-filled email for the user to send to friends
  * using FB connect
  * tweet on Twitter

### On-line High Score Tables ###
While an overall 'who scored the highest ever' is fun, the key here is to allow comparison with friends. One way to do this is via FB connect, showing your high scores alongside all your FB friends' high scores.
