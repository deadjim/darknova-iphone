# Introduction #
This page is the Community Manager's page for plans to grow the Dark Nova community. It's not just code that can be open and transparent - so can community plans, which is why this document is public. So feel free to add your own ideas and comments.

(Community requirements for the game itself are on a separate Wiki page.)

= FB 'username'
We need 25 followers to get ourselves a 'username'. Currently we've only got 17. Once 1.031 is released, adding lots of lovely stability, I'll push for new members of the FB group and then get the username sorted.

# Post ideas #
_Most of these should work for any medium: blog, FB & Twitter. Note when it's specific to a medium._

**What's the most money you've made from selling tribbles?**
And other similar posts that encourage comments and replies to help spread the word virally.

**Who do you pretend your captains are?**
Mal? Han Solo? Avon?

**About Pieter**
Mention PalmOS, and how the author is happy about DN, and might even have given us some ideas for the future of DN (possibly mention Picoverse)
http://ticc.uvt.nl/~pspronck/spacetrader/STInformation.html

**Announce UserVoice stuff on FB**
Wait for more fans for best result.

**Mention criminal quests**
Not everyone will realise you get different quests if you're on the wrong side of the police.

# Site to get contact to promote DN #
_Need to wait until the crashes have been dealt with before doing this - don't want bad review or posts just because it's a bit unstable at the moment_

**iPhone game/app review sites**
Submit for reviews.

**iPhone 'download' sites**
Clearly the downloads are all via iTunes/App Store, but it portals of iPhone apps exxist, make sure DN is listed.

What are good tags (or things to mention in descriptions)?
iPhone, game, space, trader, elite, spacetrader, turn-based, roleplaying, drugwars, palm
